Hi there, while we've been working very hard on the next Amarok feature release, the <b>2.8</b>, we also haven't forgot the majority of our users using the stable versions.<br />
<br />

Welcome <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.7.1">Amarok 2.7.1</a>, a very close relative of 2.7.0 with just a couple of very important bug fixes. The 2.7.1 is also an opportunity for Arch Linux to package it correctly. :-)<br />
<br />

Don't fear that we've made just <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=amarok.git&amp;a=shortlog&amp;h=86adaf02f0d3cd1a29c8f13dac454aad3f47ab2b">8 commits</a> since 2.7.0. In fact, we've made over 300 by 25 different people! Look forward for better transcoding, ASX playlist and Opus audio format support, improved MusicBrainz tag guessing and improvements of existing features all over the place for Amarok 2.8.0.
