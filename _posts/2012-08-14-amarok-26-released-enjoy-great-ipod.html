Finally, after endless weeks of waiting, <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.6">the beast in the form of Amarok 2.6.0 has been released to the wild</a>!<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-chUMkxEmTrc/UCkdrQd2VFI/AAAAAAAAAH8/er4ilQcyXoQ/s1600/amarok-2.6.0-screenie-take-1-orig.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="330" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-chUMkxEmTrc/UCkdrQd2VFI/AAAAAAAAAH8/er4ilQcyXoQ/s640/amarok-2.6.0-screenie-take-1-orig.png" width="640" /></a></div>This release is a bit special to me because it is the first one to include a significant contribution from me - most notably the <b><a href="http://strohel.blogspot.com/2012/04/amaroks-rewritten-ipod-plugin-testers.html">totally rewritten iPod support</a></b>. I must say thank here to everyone who tested it in the beta phase; your bug reports helped to polish it to otherwise unachievable level for the final release.<br /><br />My other personal favourites of this release include <b>transcoding at more places</b>&nbsp;and crucial bug fixes so that <b>Amarok doesn't loose your ratings</b> and stuff when it doesn't have to. This is just one item of the multi-page long list of fixed bugs.<br /><br />In short, <b>Amarok 2.6</b>&nbsp;shines like never and is an absolute must for you. :-) Do you like it? Me and other awesome Amarok &amp; KDE volunteer hackers will <a href="http://dot.kde.org/2012/08/13/support-2012-kde-randa-meetings-inspired-and-intense">meet in Switzerland's Randa</a>&nbsp;to code, discuss and plan immersely, please consider <a href="http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18045">donating to help us cover the expenses</a>. Thanks!
