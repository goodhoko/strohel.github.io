<p>Heya folk,<br />
I need your help. Amarok has been able to <a href="/amarok-27-beta-to-be-released-soon-try/">sync personal metadata like <i>play count</i>, <i>rating</i>, <i>labels</i></a> with your library on <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> since version 2.7. Unfortunately one of the most valuable piece of information, <b>last played time</b> (and also first played time) still cannot be synced due to minor omission in Last.fm Web Service API.</p>

<p>Yesterday I've seen third user requesting this feature. That was enough for me. Let them <i>hear our needs</i>! Please <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=2c6a&amp;t=2c6a.40&amp;f=2c6a.6c4a3f&amp;q=2c6a.6c4a3f" target="_blank"><b>vote on the API suggestion</b> I've submitted to provide <b>last played time</b></a>. No registration needed, just pick your nick. You can also <a href="http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=2c6a&amp;t=2c6a.40&amp;f=2c6a.152e0&amp;q=2c6a.152e0" target="_blank">vote on an existing suggestion to also provide <b>first played time</b></a>.</p>

<p>If there is enough of us, the chances are high that Last.fm will implement these suggestions and I'll be able to make statistics synchronization with Last.fm even more useful in <b>Amarok 2.9</b>.</p>
