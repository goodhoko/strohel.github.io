<div style="text-align: justify;">Ahoj, this is my fifth weekly report about my work on a Google Summer of Code project to <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/strohel/32001">rewrite MTP (Android) support in Amarok from scratch</a>. Last week was also affected by me attending Akademy, so I'll also talk about some of my Amarok-related work there. Fortunately I've still managed to fulfil my GSoC goal scheduled for week 5: playability.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />

<b>What I've done last week:</b></div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Fixed long-standing and severe <a href="http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279560">track organizing</a> <a href="http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=302251">bugs on Windows</a> in cooperation with Patrick von Reth. Thanks, Patrick!</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Sat down with Ã€lex Fiestas and <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=317485">debugged a solid bug</a> that prevents Amarok from seeing your USB storage drives and iPods that are connected at the time Amarok starts.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Fixed a <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322415">couple of</a> <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=322603">bugs</a> that I've introduced shortly before releasing 2.8 Beta, one of which was unfortunately severe.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Finally implemented playability of MTP tracks in my GSoC branch. Unfortunately not as asynchronously as I wanted, because phonon (at least phonon-gstreamer 4.6.3) cannot cope with tracks that are still being downloaded, so I do some "asynchronous with blocking waiting in the main thread with a timeout" instead.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Hmm, actually now I get an idea how we could fool Phonon. We know file size in advance, so perhaps we can pre-size the temporary file at the beginning of the transfer (which will also help fragmentation). Needs testing tough.</li></ul><b>Problems I've faced:</b><br />
<ul><li>As said above, Phonon needing the entire file before starting playback (or perhaps there's another trick?).</li><li>Amarok's Meta::Track API is not really being suited for tracks that want to asynchronously load themselves before playing.</li></ul><b>What's next:</b><br />
<ul><li>Editing track metadata and more overall polish.</li></ul>You can view and test my code by checking out <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=clones%2Famarok%2Flaitl%2Famarok.git&amp;a=shortlog&amp;h=gsoc">gsoc branch of my personal Amarok clone repository</a>.<br />
