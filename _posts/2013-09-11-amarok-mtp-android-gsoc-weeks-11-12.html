<div style="text-align: justify;">Yay, I've achieved a significant goal in my GSoC project to <a href="https://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2013/strohel/32001">rewrite MTP (Android) support in Amarok from scratch</a>. Yes, it is the ability to fully manage tracks on your MTP devices.

<br />
<br />
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W39Re8sVWrs/Ui-2HKbaFpI/AAAAAAAAAt4/HcMsGb5pxAQ/s1600/GSoC2013-MTP-w12-copying-to-MTP.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="/images/2013-09-11-amarok-mtp-android-gsoc-weeks-11-12-GSoC2013-MTP-w12-copying-to-MTP.png" width="339" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Amarok copying tracks to Android device</td></tr></tbody></table><br />
</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>What I've done last weeks:</b><br />
<ul><li>Added fancy progress bars when downloading/uploading/updating tracks on the MTP device. The progress bars are "cumulative", which means that there is only one progress bar for a given type of operation and device. Potential new jobs are added to it when it is already running.</li></ul>&nbsp;<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gprgCwB5nY8/Ui-6L6onF_I/AAAAAAAAAuI/pZJMVkCfMPU/s1600/GSoC2013-MTP-w12-editing.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="304" src="/images/2013-09-11-amarok-mtp-android-gsoc-weeks-11-12-GSoC2013-MTP-w12-editing.png" width="320" /></a></div><ul><li>Reworked locking in order not to hold 2 locks simultaneously. There are N + 2 locks in each MTP collection (where N is the number of tracks) and holding any 2 of them simultaneously creates a potential deadlock situation (unless lock order is preserved) and may stall the UI for significant time. I managed to sneak in a fancy static (compile-time) assertion because I had to provide a copy constructor for a libmtp library object.</li><li>Implemented removal of tracks on MTP device. This was rather easy, also comes with a progress feedback, but it is too fast to be screeshot-able. :)</li><li>And finally <b>implemented copying/moving tracks to the MTP device</b>. This means that Amarok is now able to fully manage audio content of your Android phones and other MTP devices! It took a bit of effort, but it works nicely now. I've even tested crazy things like plugging the device out in the middle of a move operation to check the behaviour is correct (it is and Amarok doesn't crash nor eat your kittens (YMMV)).</li></ul></div><ul></ul><b>What's next:</b><br />
<ul><li>Allowing to specify a folder structure and show human-readable folders for existing tracks.</li><li>A config dialog for each device.</li><li>Transcoding (low-level part is virtually done, only needs UI).</li></ul>You can view and test my code by checking out <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=clones%2Famarok%2Flaitl%2Famarok.git&amp;a=shortlog&amp;h=gsoc">gsoc branch of my personal Amarok clone repository</a>.
