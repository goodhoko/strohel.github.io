Hi, I'm MatÄ›j Laitl and this summer I've been <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2012">accepted</a> to <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSoC</a> for <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> to work on <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2012/strohel/15001">statistics synchronization between various collections and scrobbling services such as Last.fm</a>.&nbsp;Here comes my first weekly report, enjoy reading it. :-) In short, I've worked on a background worker that will associate same tracks from various sources with each other.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j5z3NtZAPcY/T7_39pcrTqI/AAAAAAAAAFA/wMK3RA2uxEA/s1600/amarok-gsoc-week1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j5z3NtZAPcY/T7_39pcrTqI/AAAAAAAAAFA/wMK3RA2uxEA/s1600/amarok-gsoc-week1.png" title="Synchronize Statistics action in Amarok Tools menu" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Obligatory screenshot. Current visible effects of activating that action are none. :-)</td></tr></tbody></table><b>What I've done this week:</b><br /><ul><li>Designed core (abstract) classes that will facilitate statistics synchronization for both collection and online service tracks: TrackDelegate and TrackDelegateProvider.</li><li>Implemented these interfaces for tracks from Amarok collections (e.g. Local Collection, iPod and USB Mass storage ones...).</li><li>Implemented controller, singleton class that is entry point to synchronization functionality in Amarok.</li><li>Implemented MatchTracksJob, a job that runs in background and matches tracks from multiple providers into track tuples with same meta-data.</li></ul><b>Problems I've faced:</b><br /><ul><li>Encapsulating asynchronous API of some Amarok classes (QueryMaker) to be synchronous and thread-aware was a bit tricky.</li><li>I had hard time implementing <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">lessThan()</span> comparison function that needs third argument for Qt's <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New',Courier,monospace;">qSort()</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: inherit;">. Function template did the job, but that made&nbsp;</span>MatchTracksJob non-reentrant. :-(</li><li>It isn't clear what meta-data should participate in track matching. Some sources provide few of them (Last.fm provides just artist, album, title; sometimes less) while Local Collection and friends can provide much more. I've made MatchTrackJob generic with regards to matched fields with artist, album, title being mandatory and composer, year, track &amp; disc number being optional.</li></ul><b>What's next:</b><br /><ul><li>We've ongoing discussion with Bart Cerneels whether TrackDelegate is redundant or not. I've made sure to code in a way that it can be replaced in future without hassle.</li><li>The GUI to show matched tracks, providers etc.</li></ul>You can test my work by pulling and <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/myriam/archives/87">building</a> <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/index.php?p=clones%2Famarok%2Flaitl%2Famarok.git&amp;a=shortlog&amp;h=refs/heads/gsoc">gsoc branch</a> of <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=clones%2Famarok%2Flaitl%2Famarok.git&amp;a=summary">my Amarok git repository clone</a>, <strike><i>but beware that it currently contains <a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/104966/">an unrelated change</a> (pending to be merged) that will make your Amarok database temporarily incompatible with current Amarok git master.</i></strike> <i>Update: the change has been merged!</i> I also publish weekly diffs with more technical details on KDE's review board which may be a more convenient way to review my code and to comment on it: <a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/105055/">week 1</a>
