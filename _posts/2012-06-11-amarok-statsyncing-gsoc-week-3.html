Hi, in case you forgot, I'm working on <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2012/strohel/15001">my GSoC project about statictics synchronization in Amarok</a>. Previous report was rather early, this one is a bit late. The main success this week is that the synchronization actually works (best tested with iPods), hooray!<br />
<br />

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g4i2m3LnAfQ/T9XPH75R_BI/AAAAAAAAAGA/APuLisGOIrk/s1600/amarok1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="406" src="/images/2012-06-11-amarok-statsyncing-gsoc-week-3-amarok1.png" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Progress on the Synchronize Statistics dialogue. You can see conflict resolution, updated fields would be in bold, but the are none.</td></tr></tbody></table><br />
<b>What I've done this week:</b><br />
<ul><li>Implemented ability to compute synchronized value for each field, this is shown in UI. Fields that are going to be updated are in bold.</li><li>Improve the UI to be able to sort, filter-as-you type and filter based on synchronization status (updated, not touched, having conflict).</li><li>Made the synchronization smart so that it for example doesn't want to update labels of an iPod track, which doesn't support labels at all.</li><li>Changed core Amarok classes so that first, last played time and play count can be written back to tracks.</li><li>Implemented actual synchronization worker on top of all this. The worker runs in a thread and is abort-able.</li></ul><b>Problems I've faced:</b><br />
<ul><li>There is currently no way to determine what statistics fields are supported by given Amarok collection. I had to use some heuristics as a temporary solution.</li><li>Setting some track fields is inconsistent in core Amarok classes. For example setRating() and setScore() are in Meta::Track while I really think they should be in a specialized class called EditCapability.</li><li>No other collection than the main one supports track labels currently (AFAIK), so I cannot really test this feature.</li></ul><b>What's next:</b><br />
<ul><li>I've already done much of the agenda for the next week, so:</li><li>I'll work on polishing the synchronization UI and behaviour a bit more to remove some corner-cases that currently exist.</li><li>I'll improve handling of rating conflicts: I plan the "Take ratings from..." button to mass-resolve unresolved rating conflicts.</li></ul>You can test my work by pulling and <a href="http://blogs.fsfe.org/myriam/archives/87">building</a> <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/index.php?p=clones%2Famarok%2Flaitl%2Famarok.git&amp;a=shortlog&amp;h=refs/heads/gsoc">gsoc branch</a> of <a href="http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=clones%2Famarok%2Flaitl%2Famarok.git&amp;a=summary">my Amarok git repository clone</a>, it already works! I also publish weekly diffs with more technical details on KDE's review board which may be a more convenient way to review my code and to comment on it: <a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/105055/">week 1</a> <a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/105100/">week 2</a> <a href="https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/105219/">week 3</a>
