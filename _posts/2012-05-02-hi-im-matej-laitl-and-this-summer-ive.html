Hi, I'm MatÄ›j Laitl and this summer I've been <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2012">accepted</a> to <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">GSoC</a> for <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> to work on <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/google/gsoc2012/strohel/15001">statistics synchronization between various collections and scrobbling services such as Last.fm</a>.<br />
<br />

First, let me thank Google for sponsoring such a wonderful programme that lets me code on open-source during summer - instead of having to take boring jobs involving proprietary software. Now, about my GSoC project.<br />
<br />

"Statistics synchronization, sounds boring" you say? Maybe, but I'll polish it to perfection and the second part of the project, two-way synchronization with Last.fm, is as far as I know unparallelled among audio players. My personal goal is to make the UI as intuitive as possible, not getting in the way. My mentor is <a href="http://mamarok.wordpress.com/">Myriam</a>, Amarok's famous bug wrangler, user supporter and community worker so I'm pretty confident it will go smoothly.<br />
<br />

For start I plan to come up with a couple of use-case scenarios and further iron-out the overall design <i>(is it just me or do others get the best ideas while in shower?)</i> during community binding period. <i>(since I'm already quite bound to the community)</i>&nbsp;:-)<br />
<br />

What are <i>your</i>&nbsp;expectations for Amarok statistics synchronization?
