Are you waiting impatiently for KDE 4.9? Warm-up your compilers with <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.6/RC/1">Amarok 2.6-RC that has been released just now</a>! There have been a couple of bigger fixes since Beta 1, so we want to make sure that nothing hits your grandma in 2.6 final. Give it a good testing and report possible bugs to Bugzilla as usual. Thanks!
