Back in October 2017 I gave a talk at Czech [backendisti.cz](https://backendisti.cz/) titled
*How to Count All Cars in the World Using Satellites and Google Cloud*.

The Czech (sorry) talk was about how we employ Google Cloud Platform for massively ditributed
neural network inference of satellite imagery at SpaceKnow.
