In case you don't know it yet, we've <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/en/releases/2.7">just released Amarok 2.7</a>! This release is called <i>A Minor Tune</i>, partially because the list of new features isn't pages-long (but you still get <b>statistics synchronization</b> and preliminary <b>Nepomuk integration</b>). But I believe it will be remembered for its level of polish and stability - many components like audio CD playback and file browser have been made much more solid, and the number of user-reported problems that were closed since 2.6 approaches stunning <b>500</b>.<br /><br />On the other hand, due to the lack of manpower there are still components that deserve much more love than they currently get. One such example is the MTP player plug-in, but don't fear, we (or I) have plans with it. Contributions in any form (patches being best) are of course more than welcome.
