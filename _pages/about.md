Hi, my name is MatÄ›j and this site is my technical blog.
I'm a passionate software developer, open-source enthusiast, tinkerer, learner.

I have [contributed to the Linux kernel](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&q=laitl),
[to Gentoo Linux](https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo/historical.git/log/?qt=grep&q=laitl),
and [a bit here & there](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/strohel/positions).
I was a core developer and release manager of the [Amarok music player](https://amarok.kde.org/)
(Qt/C++ desktop app), completing two [Google Summer of Code programmes for it](/tags/#GSoC).

During computer science studies at [FNSPE CTU](https://www.fjfi.cvut.cz/en/)
I created [PyBayes](https://github.com/strohel/PyBayes), a Python library for Bayesian statistics,
and later [Ceygen](), a Python ([Cython](https://github.com/cython/cython)) <-> [Eigen](eigen.tuxfamily.org/) (C++) bridge for overhead-free linear algebra with small vectors.[^pyo3]

[^pyo3]: Rust didn't yet have its 1.0 release and [Py03](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3) didn't exist at the time.

On the commercial side, I have worked on:
- developing and later leading the development of a C++ video streaming backend at [nangu.TV](https://nangu.tv/),
- developing and later leading the development of a distributed Python satellite imagery analysis system at [SpaceKnow](https://spaceknow.com/),
- software architecture and development culture of a Kotlin cultural & ticketing platform backend at [GoOut](https://goout.net/).

Since 2018, I have been [intrigued by Rust](https://github.com/strohel?tab=repositories&q=rust).
Ping me if you want to build something Rusty together!
